### 14.2 Expected Questions & Answers

**Q1: Why did you choose Ghana cultural tourism?**
*A: Ghana offers rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and significant historical sites. It's an emerging tourism destination that deserves more international attention. The topic allowed me to showcase both natural wonders and cultural significance while creating visually compelling content.*

**Q2: Why did you choose these specific six destinations?**
*A: I selected destinations that represent different aspects of Ghana's appeal:
- Kakum (nature/adventure)
- Cape Coast & Elmina (history/heritage)
- Mole (wildlife)
- Lake Bosomtwe (natural beauty)
- Wli Waterfalls (scenic wonders)
This diversity showcases Ghana's varied tourism offerings.*

**Q3: How does your carousel background synchronization work?**
*A: The carousel uses Swiper.js for slide transitions. I added custom JavaScript that listens to the 'slideChange' event. When triggered, it:
1. Fades out the current background (0.5s)
2. Updates the background-image URL
3. Fades in the new background (0.5s)
4. Simultaneously updates the text content with a shorter fade (0.3s)
This creates a seamless, synchronized transition.*

**Q4: How did you ensure accessibility?**
*A: Multiple approaches:
- Semantic HTML5 elements (nav, main, article, section)
- Alt text for all images
- WCAG AA color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- ARIA labels where needed
- Tested with screen readers*

**Q5: Why didn't you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap?**
*A: The requirement specified manual coding without WYSIWYG tools. Custom CSS allowed me to:
- Demonstrate my understanding of core CSS
- Create a unique design system
- Keep file sizes smaller
- Have complete control over styling
- Show proficiency in modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)*

**Q6: How did you optimize for performance?**
*A:
- Compressed all images (under 300KB each)
- Used WebP format with JPEG fallbacks
- Implemented lazy loading for below-fold images
- Minified CSS and JavaScript
- Used CSS transforms for animations (GPU acceleration)
- Efficient JavaScript (no unnecessary DOM manipulation)
- Hosted on CDN (GitHub Pages/Netlify)*

**Q7: What was your biggest challenge?**
*A: Creating smooth synchronization between carousel slides and background images while maintaining performance. Initially, background changes were jarring. I solved this by implementing overlapping fade transitions with careful timing (background fades 0.5s, content 0.3s) to create fluid motion.*

**Q8: How is your site responsive?**
*A: Mobile-first approach:
- Base styles for mobile (320px+)
- Media queries at 768px (tablet) and 1024px (desktop)
- Flexible layouts using Flexbox and Grid
- Responsive typography with clamp()
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Hamburger menu on mobile
- Tested on real devices*

**Q9: Why Swiper.js instead of building your own carousel?**
*A: While I could build a basic carousel, Swiper.js provides:
- Battle-tested code used by major sites
- Touch/swipe support out of the box
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility features
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Allowed me to focus on unique features (background sync)
- Industry standard practice (knowing when to use libraries)*

**Q10: How did you validate your code?**
*A: Multiple validation steps:
- W3C HTML Validator (zero errors)
- W3C CSS Validator (zero errors)
- ESLint for JavaScript
- Browser DevTools console (no errors)
- Manual testing across browsers
- Accessibility audits (WAVE, axe)*

**Q11: What would you improve if you had more time?**
*A:
- Add a blog section with travel stories
- Implement a trip planning tool with budget calculator
- Add weather widget for each destination
- Create video content for destinations
- Multi-language support (English, French)
- User reviews/testimonials section
- Integration with booking platforms
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features*

**Q12: How does this meet the assignment requirements?**
*A: [Reference specific requirements]:
1. Multi-page website: 8 pages ✓
2. Standard web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JS ✓
3. Content organization: Clear hierarchy, semantic HTML ✓
4. Navigation: Consistent across all pages ✓
5. Manual coding: No WYSIWYG tools used ✓
6. Public hosting: Live on GitHub Pages ✓
7. Documentation: Complete technical report ✓
8. Defense: Prepared to explain all decisions ✓*

### 14.3 Demo Script

**Opening (30 seconds)**
"Thank you for attending my presentation. Today I'll showcase Tour Ghana, a modern tourism website promoting Ghana's cultural heritage and natural wonders. Let me give you a quick tour."

**Home Page (1 minute)**
"Starting at the home page, notice the impactful hero section with 'VISIT GHANA' as the focal point. As I scroll down, watch how the carousel works - it auto-advances every 5 seconds, and notice how the background image smoothly transitions to match each destination. I can also control it manually using these arrows or dots."

**Navigation (30 seconds)**
"The navigation remains consistent across all pages. On mobile, it transforms into a hamburger menu. Let me show you by resizing the browser."

**Destination Page (1 minute)**
"Clicking on Kakum brings us to its dedicated page. The hero section uses a parallax effect - watch as I scroll. Below, we have comprehensive information about the destination, practical details, and a gallery carousel showcasing multiple views."

**Responsive Design (30 seconds)**
"Here's the site on mobile - notice how the layout adapts. The carousel still works smoothly with touch gestures, and all content remains accessible and readable."

**About Page (30 seconds)**
"The About page provides travel information and includes a working contact form with validation."

**Closing (20 seconds)**
"The site is live at [URL], fully validated, and documented. I'm happy to answer any questions about the technical implementation or design decisions."
